# E-commerce Product Catalog System
# Objective: The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate a deep understanding of inheritance 
# and method overriding in Python. Students will apply these concepts to develop an E-commerce 
# Product Catalog System that handles various types of products with both common and unique attributes.

# Problem Statement: An e-commerce platform requires a system to manage different types of 
# products, such as books, electronics, and clothing. Each product type shares some 
# common characteristics but also has unique features. The system should be able to display information about each product appropriately.

# Task 1: Create Base Product Class

# Develop a base class Product with common attributes like product ID, name, price, and a method to display product information.
# Expected Outcome: A Product class that can hold general information about a product and display it.
# Task 2: Implement Subclasses for Specific Products

# (ONLY BOOK SUBCLASS REQUIRED)

# Create subclasses Book, Electronic, and Clothing that inherit from Product.
# Each subclass should have additional attributes relevant to its category (e.g., author for books, specs for electronics, size for clothing).
# Expected Outcome: Each subclass contains both inherited attributes from Product and new attributes specific to the product type.
# Task 3: Override Display Method in Subclasses

# Override the method to display product information in each subclass to include specific attributes.
# For example, the Book class should display the author, Electronic should display specs, etc.
# Expected Outcome: Calling the display method on an instance of any subclass shows both common and specific product details.
# Task 4: Test Product Catalog Functionality

# Instantiate objects of each subclass and call their display methods to ensure correct information is shown.
# Expected Outcome: The system should accurately display detailed information for each type of product, demonstrating inheritance and method overriding.
# Code Examples:

# class Product:
#     # Constructor and common attributes
#     # ...

#     def display_info(self):
#         # General method to display product info
#         # ...

# class Book(Product):
#     def __init__(self, product_id, name, price, author):
#         super().__init__(product_id, name, price)
#         self.author = author

#     def display_info(self):
#         # Overridden method for books
#         # ...

# # Example usage
# my_book = Book("123", "Python Essentials", 29.99, "J. Doe")
# my_book.display_info()

class Product:
    # Constructor and common attributes
    # ...
    def __init__(self, product_id, name, price):
        self.product_id = product_id
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

    def display_info(self):
        # General method to display product info
        # ...
        print(f"Product ID : {self.product_id}")
        print(f"Name : {self.name}")
        print(f"Price : {self.price}")


class Book(Product):
    def __init__(self, product_id, name, price, author):
        super().__init__(product_id, name, price)
        self.author = author

    def display_info(self):
        # Overridden method for books
        # ...
        print(f"Product ID : {self.product_id}")
        print(f"Name : {self.name}")
        print(f"Price : {self.price}")
        print(f"Author : {self.author}")

my_book = Book("123", "Python Essentials", 29.99, "J. Doe")
my_book.display_info()
